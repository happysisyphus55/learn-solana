# What is Solana? 
Solana allows people to transact directly with each other instantly at almost no cost.

Compared to older platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is:

Significantly faster - most transactions complete in a second or two.

Massively cheaper - transaction fees (referred to as 'gas fees' in older networks) are typically $0.00025 (much less than one penny) regardless of the value of what's being transferred.

Highly decentralized, having one of the highest Nakamoto coefficients (decentralization score) of any proof-of-stake network.

Many of the common use cases on Solana are only possible on Solana, due to the high costs and slow translation times of older blockchains.
